## Coding an Steem-based App 
Here, we will be developing an **Android** App whose backend will be hosted on **Steem-blockchain**. Although this is a simple App which will fetch the data (i.e. reading, not writing). In subsequent tutorials, we will be learning _reading from_ and _writing to_ the Steem-database in lot more details.
